Customer Booking Prediction â€“ British Airways Data Science Simulation
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer bookings using machine learning, based on a dataset provided in the British Airways Data Science Simulation. A Random Forest Classifier was trained to identify key factors influencing bookings, providing actionable insights for data-driven decision-making in the airline industry.

Key Features
âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ Encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical features.
âœ… Model Training & Evaluation â€“ Using Random Forest to predict booking completion, with performance assessed through accuracyand precision.
âœ… Feature Importance Analysis â€“ Identifying key factors driving customer booking behavior.
âœ… Visualization & Insights â€“ Creating data-driven visuals to support business decisions.

Results
ðŸ“Š Accuracy: 85.19%
ðŸ“Œ Top Influencing Features: Purchase Lead, Route, Flight Hour, and Length of Stay.

Next Steps
ðŸš€ Enhance Model Performance â€“ Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved recall on actual bookings.
ðŸ“¡ Deploy & Monitor â€“ Integrate with a real-world system for continuous learning.
