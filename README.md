# **Customer Booking Prediction – British Airways Data Science Simulation** ✈️📊  

## **Project Overview**  
What makes a customer hit **"Book Now"** or abandon their reservation? This project uncovers the hidden patterns behind booking decisions using **machine learning**! By training a **Random Forest Classifier**, we analyze key factors influencing customer behavior, turning data into powerful insights that help airlines **boost revenue and enhance customer experiences**.  

## **Key Features**  
✅ **Smart Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, encoding, and standardizing data for optimal model performance.  
✅ **AI-Powered Predictions** – Training a **Random Forest model** to forecast customer bookings with precision.  
✅ **Data-Driven Decision Making** – Identifying the **top factors** influencing bookings to optimize airline strategies.  
✅ **Visual Insights** – Transforming complex patterns into **easy-to-understand visualizations** for business impact.  

## **Results**  
📊 **Model Accuracy:** 85.19%  
📌 **Top Influencing Factors:** Purchase Lead, Route, Flight Hour, Length of Stay  

## **Next Steps**  
🚀 **Boost Performance** – Fine-tune the model to improve recall for completed bookings.  
📡 **Real-World Integration** – Deploy the model and continuously refine it with fresh data for even better predictions.
