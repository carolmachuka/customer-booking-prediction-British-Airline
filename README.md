**Predicting Customer Bookings – British Airline**

### **Objective**
- Develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a customer completing a booking.

### **Data Source**
- The dataset, provided by Forage for British Airways, consists of 50,000 entries and 14 variables.
  
### **Key Actions Taken**
✅ **Data Preprocessing**
- Encoded categorical variables and standardized numerical features.

✅ **Model Selection**
- Training a **Random Forest model** to forecast customer bookings,  assessed the model's accuracy. 
  
✅ **Feature Importance Analysis**
- Identified the **top factors** influencing bookings to optimize airline strategies.
- 
### **Results**
📊 **Model Performance**
- **Precision:** 85.19%

🔍 **Top Features Influencing Bookings**
1. Purchase lead (how early the booking was made)
2. Route (travel path)
3. Flight hour
4. Length of stay


### **Next Steps**
🚀 **Deploy Model & Monitor Performance**
- Implement in a real-world system.
- Continuously monitor performance.
- Further optimize based on new customer data insights.
